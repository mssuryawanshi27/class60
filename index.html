        <p>My favourite hobby is reading fantasy and sci-fi novels. I love reading because it influences my thoughts and actions and it's something I do in my free time or when I'm feeling melancholy. Books store thoughts, emotions, plots and involuted characters. When I read a good novel, it's like I'm stepping in someone else's shoes and my brain wanders around to new ideas. It's a hobbly I love and want to develop in.</p>
